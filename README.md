# jQuery-Animations-Demo
This HTML document demonstrates various jQuery animations and effects. The page features a central box (#animationBox) that can be animated in different ways using buttons provided in a button container below the box.
The buttons trigger animations such as sliding down, sliding up, fading in, fading out, and custom animation which moves the box, changes its opacity, and alters its size. Additionally, the custom animation changes the background color of the box. The jQuery script handles these interactions, providing smooth and visually appealing animations. Basic CSS styles the box and buttons for a cohesive and user-friendly interface.
